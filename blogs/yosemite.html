                <p>Artifical Intelligence has existed for quite a long time, but its advance only became to the level it is today about a couple years ago; when AI became far more advanced with technology such as ChatGPT or generative image AI. I became far more invested with AI technology at this time, and wanted to find ways where I can explore it further. I was already in some activities such as my schoolâ€™s Machine Learning club, but I wanted to explore it more than what my school could offer me. 
</p>
                <p>This is how I ended up finding out about the International Conference On Artificial Intelligence, or ICOAI. By applying to it, I would get the chance to research on a topic relating to Artificial Intelligence, and then writing my first ever research article. This was a big opportunity for me; it would be my first time getting to write a research paper in an academic conference, and on a topic that I was heavily invested in at that.
</p>
                <p>
There was one problem initially; because of my age, I would have to work as a co-author for another participant instead of working on my own article fully, which was a slight setback. While it did feel somewhat disappointing that I did not get to work on my own paper fully, I was still excited to go through the process of learning more about Artificial Intelligence and writing a paper about it. 
</p>
                <p>I was to work with a senior student and another professor on the topic of using Artificial Intelligence to predict the trends in the stock market. During the research process, I learnt a lot of things about it that I never really knew before; every bit of evidence had a deeper meaning that you could hypothesize, and any information was vital to put as it could drastically change the meaning. It was quite challenging to work on the research paper and gather data, bur at the same time my passion allowed me to keep going through all the hard work and contribute to the research paper.
